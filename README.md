| `NUMBER-NUMBER rNUMBER` | Select range with exclusions                               | `1-5 r3` |
| `c`                     | Clear all selections                                       |          |
| `v`                     | View current selections                                    |          |
| `pr`                    | Print selected files to console                            |          |
| `m`                     | Return to main menu                                        |          |

**Note on directory selection:**

- Commands without `s` prefix (like `3` or `1-5`) select items as individual entries. If a directory is selected this way, it's treated as a single item without including its contents.
- Commands with `s` prefix (like `s2` or `s1-3`) recursively select all files within directories and their subfolders.
